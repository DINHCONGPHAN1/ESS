\opening{Dear Editor,} % eg Hello.

I am submitting a manuscript titled {\em Generalized Rybicki Press algorithm}. This manuscript discusses an $\mathcal{O}(N)$, direct, numerically stable algorithm for inverting covariance matrices, whose entries are obtained as sum of exponentials. The algorithm is in-fact true for a large class of structured dense matrices known as semi-separable matrices. This manuscript also serves to formally announce the release of the implementation of the $\mathcal{O}(N)$ solver for semi-separable matrices made available at the following repository: \url{https://github.com/sivaramambikasaran/ESS}.

\closing{Regards,\\
Sivaram Ambikasaran}
